# Introduction
## 1.2 what's ML?
Machine Learning: 
1.  field of study that gives computers the ability of learn without being explicitly programmed.
2.  "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."
task:
T: classify emails as spam or not spam.
E: watch your label emails as spams or not spam. 
P: the number of emails classified as spam or not spam.
## 1.3 Supervised Learning 
We teach the computer to learn.
监督学习，即为教计算机如何去完成预测任务（有反馈），预先给一定数据量的输入和对应的结果即训练集，建模拟合，最后让计算机预测未知数据的结果。
1. regression: 预测连续的值
2. classification：预测离散的值

## 1.4 Unsupervised Learning 
The computer learn by itself.我们不会给出任何带标注的数据集。
1.  聚类算法：新闻聚合
2.  非聚类算法：鸡尾酒问题，将说话者的声音同背景音乐分离出来。
